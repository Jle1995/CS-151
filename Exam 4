Section 1: Syntax Write ONLY the statements requested and required.
1) Initialize three char arrays to “Initial” in different ways. (Initialization is the process of declaring and assigning a value to a variable in a single step.)
char initial[3] = {‘J’, ‘T’, ‘L’};
2) Write the declaration of a struct named Grade that has a double and a string as members named gpa and letter respectively. struct Grade 
{
double gpa;
string gpa;
};
Grade Class1;
Grade Class2;
Grade Class3;
  
3) Given a double pointer variable, e, that has been declared, write a statement(s) that perform a single dynamic memory allocation and assigns it 2.71828.
double * e;
e = new float;
*e = 2.71828;
delete e;

4) Given a double array, num, that has been initialized consisting of 10 elements and a double pointer variable, ptr, that has be declared, write a statement(s) that assigns the address of num to ptr, and then, double each element of num using only ptr (you cannot use num int the assignments).
double *ptr;
double num[10];
ptr = new double[10];
num = &ptr;
ptr = double[0];
ptr = double[1];
ptr = double[2];
ptr = double[3];
ptr = double[4];
ptr = double[5];
ptr = double[6];
ptr = double[7];
ptr = double[8];
ptr = double[9];
ptr = double[10];
5) Given a string pointer variable, str, that has been dynamically allocated for a block, write a statement(s) that will deallocate str.
string *ptr;
ptr = new string[0];
delete [] ptr;
6) Given an int pointer variable, t, that has been declared, write a statement(s) that performs a block dynamic memory allocation of 15 and assigns it the first 15 positive even integers (2 is the first number). int* t;
t = new int [15];
*t = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30};
7) Given an int, n, that has been initialized and an int pointer variable, ptr, that has be declared, write a statement(s) that assigns the address of n to ptr, and then, assign 3 more than the four times n to n using only ptr (you cannot use n int the assignment). int* ptr, n;
ptr = &n;
4*ptr + 3;

8) Given a char pointer variable, ch, that has been dynamical allocated for a single element, write a statement(s) that will deallocate ch.
char *ch[1];
ch = new char [1];
delete [] ch;
